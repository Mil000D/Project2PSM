# Projectile Motion Simulation
## Program Description
This repository contains a simulation program for modeling projectile motion using Euler's method and the Midpoint method (improved Euler's method).

The program aims to provide calculations used for visualization (e.g. in Excel) of the trajectory and motion of a projectile under the influence of gravity.

## Usage
1. Run the program and provide the initial conditions for the projectile, including the initial velocity, mass, drag coefficient - k and Î”t.
2. The program will simulate the motion of the projectile using both Euler's method and the Midpoint method.
3. The calculation results, will be displayed for user.
4. User can use the data to visualize simulated trajectory in Excel or other similar tools.
